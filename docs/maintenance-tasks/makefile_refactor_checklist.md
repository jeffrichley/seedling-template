# 🛠️ Makefile Modernization Checklist

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to refactor the Makefile into a world-class structure. It is intended for use by a human developer or a coding agent.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Audit and Categorize

- [ ] Add section headers to group commands by purpose:
  - `## 🎯 Code Quality`
  - `## 🧪 Testing`
  - `## 📚 Documentation`
  - `## 📦 Build & Install`
  - `## 📈 Benchmarking`
  - `## ✅ Quality Gates`
  - `## 🧰 Utilities`

- [ ] Move each target under its respective category header.
- [ ] Sort targets within each section alphabetically for readability.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Simplify Repetitive Commands

- [ ] Define command templates at the top of the file:
  ```makefile
  PYTEST = uv run pytest tests/
  SRC_DIRS = src/ tests/
  ```

- [ ] Replace inline repeated commands with variables:
  ```makefile
  test:
    $(PYTEST) -v
  ```

- [ ] Confirm all replacements still work by running each affected target.

---

## 📦 Phase 3: Extract Complex Logic into Python Scripts

- [ ] For targets like `checkit`, move the logic into a `scripts/check.py`.
- [ ] For benchmarks, create `scripts/benchmark.py` with subcommands:
  - `run`, `report`, `baseline`

- [ ] Replace Makefile logic with calls to the new scripts:
  ```makefile
  benchmark:
    uv run python scripts/benchmark.py run
  ```

---

## 🔁 Phase 4: Add Meta-Targets

- [ ] Add grouped commands for common workflows:
  ```makefile
  dev-check: format lint checkit
  docs-all: docs docs-linkcheck
  ```

- [ ] Add comments for each meta-target.

---

## 🧼 Phase 5: Improve Help System

- [ ] Ensure each target has a `##` docstring.
- [ ] Add category separators using echo:
  ```makefile
  help:
    @echo "🎯 Code Quality:"
    ...
  ```

- [ ] Optionally, move help generation to a `scripts/make_help.py`.

---

## 🧪 Phase 6: Add Makefile Smoke Tests

- [ ] Create a `scripts/test_makefile.sh` that runs:
  - `make format`
  - `make lint`
  - `make test`
  - `make docs`
- [ ] Validate exit codes and presence of expected outputs.

---

## 🧰 Phase 7: Add Best Practice Defaults

- [ ] Add `.DEFAULT_GOAL := help`
- [ ] Add `.SILENT:` or use `@` to silence output as needed
- [ ] Add `MAKEFLAGS += --no-builtin-rules --warn-undefined-variables`

---

## 🧭 Phase 8: Modularize for Reuse

- [ ] Extract common commands into a `devtools.mk`
- [ ] In your main Makefile:
  ```makefile
  include devtools.mk
  ```

- [ ] Support customization via environment variables or override variables.
