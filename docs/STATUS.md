# Project Vine - Current Status

> Last Updated: 2025-01-27
> Version: 0.1.0
> Status: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress

## üéØ Current Status Overview

Project Vine has successfully completed **Phase 1: Foundation** and is now in **Phase 2: Advanced Features**. The core architecture is solid with 100% test coverage and a fully functional TimelineBuilder API.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Distinction: Configuration vs. Implementation

**‚úÖ Fully Implemented:**
- TimelineBuilder API with dual-mode timing
- Track-based data model (VideoTrack, AudioTrack, TextTrack)
- Pydantic models and validation
- Registry system for extensibility
- Defaults management
- Comprehensive testing (100% coverage)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Only (Not Actually Functional):**
- Animation system (Ken Burns, slide, static effects) - models exist but no rendering
- Transition system (fade, crossfade, slide) - models exist but no rendering
- Export functionality - no actual video output
- Audio processing - no actual audio mixing
- MoviePy integration - no actual MoviePy code

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation - COMPLETED

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Voice/music mixing and ducking capabilities
**Dependencies:** Audio processing libraries (librosa), MoviePy integration
**Note:** Required for actual audio processing in video generation

#### 3. Export Pipeline üîÑ
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Description:** High-quality video export functionality
**Dependencies:** MoviePy integration, performance optimization
**Note:** Required to actually output video files from the timeline

#### 4. JSON/YAML Parsers üîÑ
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** AI agent integration and human-editable configs
**Dependencies:** PyYAML library, spec building system

#### 5. Performance Optimization üîÑ
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Memory management and caching
**Dependencies:** MoviePy integration, profiling tools
