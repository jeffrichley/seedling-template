# Project Vine - Current Status

> Last Updated: 2025-07-29
> Version: 0.1.0
> Status: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress

## üéØ Current Status Overview

Project Vine has successfully completed **Phase 1: Foundation** and is now in **Phase 2: Advanced Features**. The core architecture is solid with 100% test coverage and a fully functional TimelineBuilder API.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Distinction: Configuration vs. Implementation

**‚úÖ Fully Implemented:**
- TimelineBuilder API with dual-mode timing (sequential and explicit)
- Track-based data model (VideoTrack, AudioTrack, TextTrack)
- Pydantic models and validation
- Registry system for extensibility
- Defaults management
- Comprehensive testing (211 tests with 70% coverage)
- Google-style API behavior for current time updates

**‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Only (Not Actually Functional):**
- Animation system (Ken Burns, slide, static effects) - models exist but no rendering
- Transition system (fade, crossfade, slide) - models exist but no rendering
- Export functionality - basic structure exists but no actual video output
- Audio processing - basic structure exists but no actual audio mixing
- MoviePy integration - basic structure exists but no actual MoviePy code

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation - COMPLETED

## üîÑ Phase 2: Advanced Features - IN PROGRESS

### Current Focus Areas

#### 1. MoviePy Integration üîÑ
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Full MoviePy wrapper implementation for actual video rendering
**Dependencies:** MoviePy library integration, audio processing
**Note:** This is the core missing piece - without this, the framework cannot actually generate videos

#### 2. Audio Processing üîÑ
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Voice/music mixing and ducking capabilities
**Dependencies:** Audio processing libraries (librosa), MoviePy integration
**Note:** Required for actual audio processing in video generation

#### 3. Export Pipeline üîÑ
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Description:** High-quality video export functionality
**Dependencies:** MoviePy integration, performance optimization
**Note:** Required to actually output video files from the timeline

#### 4. JSON/YAML Parsers üîÑ
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** AI agent integration and human-editable configs
**Dependencies:** PyYAML library, spec building system

#### 5. Performance Optimization üîÑ
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Memory management and caching
**Dependencies:** MoviePy integration, profiling tools

## ‚è≥ Phase 3: Advanced Modes - PLANNED

### Planned Features
- **Advanced track management** - Multiple tracks and layering
- **Advanced effects** - Parallax, zoom blur, custom animations
- **Text overlay** - Subtitle and text rendering
- **Music integration** - Beat detection and synchronization
- **Custom animations** - Plugin system for custom effects
- **Advanced transitions** - Complex transition effects
- **Batch processing** - Multiple video generation

## üèóÔ∏è Recent Architectural Decisions

### DEC-004: TimelineBuilder Current Time Update Behavior (2025-07-29)

**Decision:** Implement Google-style API behavior for current time updates:
- **Sequential methods** (`add_image()`, `add_text()`, `add_voice()`, etc.) **WILL update current times**
- **Explicit methods** (`add_image_at()`, `add_text_at()`, `add_voice_at()`, etc.) **WILL NOT update current times**

**Rationale:**
- Method names should be self-documenting
- Follows Google's API design patterns
- Provides predictable behavior for mixed mode workflows
- Maintains clear separation of concerns

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ More intuitive API design
- ‚úÖ Consistent with industry standards
- ‚úÖ Better support for mixed mode workflows
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change from original implementation

**Documentation:** See `.agent-os/product/decisions.md` for complete details.
