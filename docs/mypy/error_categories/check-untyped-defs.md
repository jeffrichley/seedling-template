# Check-Untyped-Defs Analysis

## Overview
This document tracks the impact of enabling `check_untyped_defs = true` in the MyPy configuration.

## Analysis Results

### Key Finding: No New Errors Revealed
- **Before**: 42 errors (36 no-untyped-def + 6 attr-defined)
- **After**: 42 errors (36 no-untyped-def + 6 attr-defined)
- **Delta**: 0 new errors

### What Changed
The main difference is that MyPy now **checks the bodies** of untyped functions instead of skipping them:

**Before (check_untyped_defs = false):**
```
src/vine/registry/base_registry.py:17: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
src/vine/registry/base_registry.py:18: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
```

**After (check_untyped_defs = true):**
- No more `[annotation-unchecked]` notes
- MyPy now validates the internal logic of untyped functions

### Error Distribution (Unchanged)
| Error Type | Count | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| `no-untyped-def` | 36 | Functions missing type annotations |
| `attr-defined` | 6 | Missing attributes on objects |

### Files Affected (Same as Before)
- `src/vine/builder/timeline_builder.py` - 13 errors
- `tests/unit/test_registry.py` - 5 errors
- `src/vine/models/tracks.py` - 4 errors
- Registry files - 9 errors total
- Rendering files - 3 errors total

## Implications

### Positive Findings
1. **No Hidden Type Issues**: The fact that no new errors appeared suggests that the untyped function bodies are relatively clean
2. **Consistent Error Surface**: All type issues are already visible at the function signature level
3. **Good Code Quality**: The internal logic of untyped functions doesn't introduce additional type problems

### What This Means for Phase 2
- **Focus on Signatures**: The main work is adding type annotations to function signatures
- **No Surprises**: No hidden type issues lurking in function bodies
- **Predictable Fixes**: The 36 `no-untyped-def` errors are the complete scope

## Next Steps
1. **Continue with Phase 2**: Focus on adding type annotations to function signatures
2. **No Additional Complexity**: The function bodies are already type-safe
3. **Maintain Setting**: Keep `check_untyped_defs = true` enabled for future validation

## Summary
- **Total Errors**: 42 (unchanged)
- **New Errors**: 0
- **Complexity**: Low (no surprises)
- **Priority**: Continue with existing Phase 2 plan
