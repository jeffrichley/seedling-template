# Static Files Directory

This directory contains static assets for the Sphinx documentation.

## Files

- `custom.css` - Custom CSS styles for the documentation
- `.gitkeep` - Ensures this directory is tracked by Git

## Usage

Add custom CSS, JavaScript, images, or other static assets here. They will be automatically included in the documentation build.

The `custom.css` file is already configured to be included in the documentation.
