# ðŸ“‹ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> "The best architecture is the one that allows for change."
> â€” **Unknown**

This section contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document the design decisions made during the development of the Seedling template.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project. They provide context for why certain decisions were made and help future maintainers understand the reasoning behind the current architecture.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, etc.)
3. **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
4. **Decision**: The decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: The consequences of the decision
6. **Alternatives**: Alternatives that were considered

## Contributing to ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR**: Use the template in `docs/adr/0001-template-design.md`
2. **Number sequentially**: Use the next available number
3. **Update this index**: Add the new ADR to the list above
4. **Get review**: Have the ADR reviewed by the team
5. **Update status**: Mark as Accepted once approved

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Date

YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

[Describe the situation that led to this decision]

## Decision

[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences

[Describe the consequences of this decision]

## Alternatives

[Describe alternatives that were considered]
```
