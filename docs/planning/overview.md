# 📽️ Project Vine – Media Composition Framework

**Project Vine** is a modular, agent-compatible, dual-mode video composition system built on top of MoviePy. Designed for AI-driven and human-assisted short-form video generation, it provides an expressive and extensible API, supports scene- and beat-based structures, and is optimized for integration with LLMs and declarative config pipelines.

---

## 🔖 Project Description (Precision Version)

Vine is a structured video generation framework that models timelines as composable blocks. Each block (scene, beat, or voice-image pair) can include voice, music, images, clips, effects, and transitions. The framework supports:

* Scene-based narrative pacing (e.g. documentaries, sermons)
* Beat-driven precision editing (e.g. TikToks, music videos)
* Hybrid combinations (e.g. emotional shorts with rhythmic mid-sections)

Built for automation at scale, it allows:

* Pydantic-validated configs (YAML/JSON)
* Agent-generated inputs
* Global/timeline/block default overrides
* Extensible registries (for transitions, animations, audio FX)

The system is tailored for content pipelines like Chrona and supports 9:16 vertical formats, multimodal rendering (image, audio, text), and parameterized editing logic (zoom direction, slide direction, effect speed, audio ducking, etc.).

## ✅ Feature List (Hyper-Specific)

### 1. 🧱 Timeline Composition

#### A. Scene-Based Editing

* `.start_scene(name: str)`
* Add voice, image, clip, text, music
* Supports J-cuts and L-cuts
* Transitions per scene or internal block

#### B. Beat-Based Editing

* `.start_beat_track(music: str, bpm: int)`
* `.on_beat(time|beat).add_clip(...)`
* `.sync_beats([...])` for timestamp-aligned editing

#### C. Hybrid Timeline Support

* Switch between scene and beat sections mid-timeline
* Flattened into unified `TimelineBlock[]` for export

#### D. Scene Structure

```text
Timeline
├── SceneBlock
│   ├── ClipBlock / TextBlock / VoiceBlock
│   ├── Transition
│   └── BeatTrack (optional)
└── SceneTransition
```

---

### 2. 🎛️ Voice–Image Pair System

`.add_voice_image_pair(voice, image)` block supports:

* Auto-duration: image displayed for length of voice file
* `.with_animation(...)`: supports pan, zoom, slide, static
* `.with_subtitle(text)`: overlays text with voice
* `.with_transition(...)`: to next block

#### Supported Animations

* `ken_burns` (zoom/pan with speed control)
* `slide_in` (directional: left, right, up, down)
* `static` (no motion)
* `zoom_blur` (planned)
* `.with_animation("ken_burns", zoom="in", speed="slow")`

#### Transition Support

* Attached to the tail of each block (`transition_to_next`)
* Types: `fade`, `crossfade`, `slide`, `glitch`, `zoom_in`
* `.with_transition("fade", duration=1.0, direction="left")`

---

### 3. 🔉 Audio Controls

* `.add_music(path, bpm=120)`
* `.add_voiceover(path)`
* `.duck_under_voice=True` on music blocks
* Audio mixing pipeline respects order and overlaps

---

### 4. 🎨 Text and Subtitle Features

* `.add_text(content, duration, font, position)`
* `.with_subtitle(...)` for voice-image pair overlays
* Subtitle support for auto-transcribed or manual input

---

### 5. 🗂️ Defaults System

#### A. Global Defaults

```python
set_global_defaults(
    animation="ken_burns",
    transition="crossfade",
    font="ChronaSans-Bold",
    resolution="1080x1920"
)
```

#### B. Timeline-Level

```python
TimelineBuilder().with_defaults(animation="slide_in", transition="fade")
```

#### C. Block-Level

```python
.add_voice_image_pair(...).with_animation("static").with_transition("slide")
```

Hierarchy:

```
Block > Timeline > Global
```

---

### 6. 📄 Structured Data & Pydantic Models

#### A. Data Model

```python
class AnimationSpec(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["ken_burns", "slide_in", "static"]
    zoom: Optional[str]
    direction: Optional[str]

class VoiceImageBlock(BaseModel):
    voice: str
    image: str
    subtitle: Optional[str]
    animation: Optional[AnimationSpec]
    transition: Optional[str]

class VineSpec(BaseModel):
    defaults: dict
    voice_image_pairs: list[VoiceImageBlock]
```

#### B. JSON/YAML Input

* `.load_vine_from_json(json_str)`
* `.load_vine_from_yaml(path)`

---

### 7. 🔧 Registry System

#### Animation Registry

```python
ANIMATION_REGISTRY = {
  "ken_burns": ken_burns_fx,
  "slide_in": slide_in_fx,
  "static": static_fx
}
@register_animation("ken_burns")
def ken_burns_fx(...): ...
```

#### Transition Registry

```python
TRANSITION_REGISTRY = {
  "fade": fade_transition,
  "slide": slide_transition
}
```

---

### 8. 🔁 Rendering Internals

Each block generates:

* `CompositeVideoClip` from:

  * `ImageClip.fx(animation_fn)`
  * `TextClip` (subtitle)
  * `AudioFileClip` (voice)
* `TransitionFn(current_clip, next_clip)` at join points
* Music track mixed separately and layered
* Output: `.export(path, resolution="1080x1920")`

---

### 9. 🧠 Agent Design Compatibility

* LLMs generate JSON → Pydantic model → `.build_from_spec(...)`
* Pydantic `.schema_json(indent=2)` used to guide agent generation
* Agents can toggle modes:

  * Scene mode
  * Beat mode
* YAML is optional; agents work via JSON → `.parse_obj()`

---

### 10. 📁 Suggested File Structure

### 🧪 Testing / QA Features (Planned)

* Auto-duration inference tests
* Transition chaining validation
* CLI support for batch processing
* Human-editable YAML validation suite
