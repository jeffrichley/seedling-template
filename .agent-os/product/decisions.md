## 2025-07-27: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Project Vine will be built as a modular, agent-compatible, track-based video composition framework using Python with MoviePy integration. The framework will support both sequential append and explicit timing modes, with a fluent API for human developers and JSON/YAML input for AI agents.

### Context

The video creation market is rapidly evolving with AI-generated content becoming mainstream. Current video processing tools lack the structured interfaces needed for AI agent integration, while also being too complex for rapid content creation. Project Vine addresses this gap by providing a framework that serves both human creativity and automated content generation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure MoviePy Wrapper**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, direct access to MoviePy features
   - Cons: No AI agent integration, limited abstraction, complex API for common tasks

2. **Web-Based Video Editor**
   - Pros: User-friendly interface, real-time preview
   - Cons: Limited AI integration, performance constraints, complex deployment

3. **Node.js Video Framework**
   - Pros: JavaScript ecosystem, web integration
   - Cons: Limited video processing libraries, performance issues with large files

4. **C++ Video Processing Library**
   - Pros: High performance, low-level control
   - Cons: Complex development, limited AI integration, steep learning curve

### Rationale

The Python + MoviePy approach was chosen because:
- **AI Integration**: Python is the dominant language for AI/ML development
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of video processing libraries and tools
- **Productivity**: Rapid development and iteration capabilities
- **Community**: Large developer community and extensive documentation
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add custom effects and plugins

The track-based editing system addresses the diverse needs of content creators:
- **Sequential mode**: For simple workflows with automatic timing
- **Explicit mode**: For complex scenarios with precise timing control

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Seamless AI agent integration through structured JSON/YAML input
- Fluent API for human developers reduces learning curve
- Extensible architecture enables community contributions
- Dual-mode editing supports diverse content creation workflows
- Type safety with Pydantic reduces runtime errors

**Negative:**
- Python dependency may limit some deployment scenarios
- MoviePy performance constraints for very large projects
- Learning curve for complex video processing concepts
- Memory usage considerations for large video projects

## 2025-07-27: TimelineBuilder Architecture Decision

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Project Vine will implement a **track-based system with dual-mode timing** for the TimelineBuilder API. This approach uses auto-detection of track types, supports both sequential append and explicit timing modes, and provides global transition support across tracks.

### Context

The original TimelineBuilder design prevented overlapping visual elements, which limited common video editing scenarios. After analyzing 15 real-world use cases, we identified the need for a system that allows natural temporal overlaps while maintaining a clean, extensible API.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Scene-Based Composition Objects**
   - Pros: Natural semantic grouping, fluent API, handles complex scenarios
   - Cons: Adds complexity, requires new Scene classes, overkill for simple cases

2. **Timeline-Based Fluent Composition**
   - Pros: Explicit timing control, fluent API, extensible
   - Cons: More verbose for simple cases, state management complexity

3. **Layer-Based System**
   - Pros: Clean separation, no method explosion, extensible
   - Cons: Less semantic grouping, harder to manage relationships

4. **Configuration-Driven Approach**
   - Pros: Very flexible, JSON/YAML friendly, no method explosion
   - Cons: Less type safety, harder to validate, runtime errors

5. **Event-Driven Timeline**
   - Pros: Very flexible, precise control, event-driven architecture
   - Cons: More complex, harder to reason about, potential for conflicting events

### Rationale

The track-based approach was selected because:

1. **Professional Compatibility**: Matches video editing software (Premiere Pro, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve)
2. **Dual-Mode Flexibility**: Sequential mode for simple workflows, explicit mode for complex scenarios
3. **Auto-Detection**: Clean API without track specification complexity
4. **Future-Proof**: Foundation for professional format export/import
5. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive for both simple and complex workflows
6. **Implementation Efficiency**: Minimal changes to existing codebase

### Technical Implementation

**Track-Based Data Model:**
```python
class VideoSpec:
    video_tracks: List[VideoTrack] = Field(default_factory=lambda: [VideoTrack("video_0")])
    audio_tracks: List[AudioTrack] = Field(default_factory=lambda: [AudioTrack("audio_0")])
    text_tracks: List[TextTrack] = Field(default_factory=lambda: [TextTrack("text_0")])
    transitions: List[Transition] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

**Dual-Mode Timing:**
- **Sequential Mode (Default)**: Elements appended sequentially
- **Explicit Mode**: Elements positioned at specific times with overlaps allowed

**Auto-Detection:**
- `add_image_at()` → video track
- `add_text_at()` → text track
- `add_voice_at()` → audio track

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Solves overlap problem for all 15 identified scenarios
- Maintains clean API without method explosion
- Provides professional video editor compatibility
- Supports both simple and complex workflows
- Foundation for future professional format integration

**Negative:**
- Requires track-based data model implementation
- Adds complexity to rendering pipeline
- Need to manage track auto-creation logic
- Potential for track management complexity in future

## 2025-07-27: Technical Architecture Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Project Vine will use a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns: User Interface Layer (Fluent API, YAML Config, AI Agent JSON), Business Logic Layer (Timeline Management, Block Processing, Registry System), Data Layer (Pydantic Models, Defaults Management, Validation Engine), and Rendering Layer (MoviePy Integration, Audio Processing, Export Pipeline).

### Context

The framework needs to support multiple input methods (fluent API, YAML configs, AI agent JSON) while maintaining a clean, extensible architecture. The layered approach ensures that each component has a single responsibility and can be developed and tested independently.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, direct access between components
   - Cons: Tight coupling, difficult testing, limited extensibility

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Pros: Independent scaling, technology diversity
   - Cons: Overkill for this use case, complex deployment, performance overhead

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Pros: Loose coupling, extensible event system
   - Cons: Complex debugging, potential performance issues, over-engineering

### Rationale

The layered architecture was chosen because:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a clear responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without affecting other layers
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make code easier to understand and modify
- **Performance**: Direct method calls within layers, optimized rendering pipeline

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear code organization and maintainability
- Easy to add new input methods or rendering backends
- Comprehensive testing capabilities
- Scalable architecture for future features

**Negative:**
- Initial development complexity

### Decision

Project Vine will implement a registry-based system for animations and transitions, allowing users to register custom effects and reuse them across projects. The registry will support both built-in effects and user-defined plugins.

### Context

Video creation requires a wide variety of effects and transitions. A registry system allows for extensibility while maintaining a consistent API. This enables community contributions and custom effects for specific use cases.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Hardcoded Effects**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, guaranteed availability
   - Cons: Limited extensibility, no community contributions

2. **Plugin System with Dynamic Loading**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, runtime plugin loading
   - Cons: Security concerns, complex implementation, potential stability issues

3. **Configuration-Based Effects**
   - Pros: Declarative approach, easy to understand
   - Cons: Limited complexity, difficult to implement advanced effects

### Rationale

The registry system was chosen because:
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new effects without modifying core code
- **Consistency**: Uniform API for all effects regardless of source
- **Community**: Enables community contributions and sharing
- **Performance**: Pre-compiled effects with optimized implementations
- **Safety**: Validation and testing of registered effects

### Consequences

**Positive:**
