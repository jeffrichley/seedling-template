"""End-to-end tests for Cursor Project.

This package contains tests that verify complete user journeys:
- Test the entire system from start to finish
- Use real implementations of all components
- Simulate actual user interactions and workflows
- Focus on complete user scenarios, not individual features
- May be the slowest tests but provide highest confidence

Use @pytest.mark.e2e to mark your tests.

Example:
    @pytest.mark.e2e
    def test_complete_shopping_cart_workflow():
        '''Complete shopping cart workflow from browse to checkout.'''

        # Arrange
        user = create_test_user()
        product = create_test_product()

        # Act
        cart = add_to_cart(user, product)
        checkout = process_checkout(cart)
        order = confirm_order(checkout)

        # Assert
        assert order.status == "confirmed"
        assert order.items[0].product_id == product.id
        assert order.user_id == user.id

Best Practices:
- Test complete user journeys and workflows
- Use real implementations of all system components
- Focus on user scenarios, not technical implementation
- Test critical business processes end-to-end
- Verify system behavior under realistic conditions
- May require test data setup and cleanup
- Consider using test environments that mirror production
