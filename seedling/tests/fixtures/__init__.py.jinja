"""Test fixtures for Cursor Project.

This package contains reusable test fixtures that provide:
- Common test data and objects
- Test environment setup and teardown
- Mock objects and stubs for external dependencies
- Utility functions for test setup
- Database connections and test data

Usage:
    Import fixtures in your test files or conftest.py:

    from tests.fixtures import your_custom_fixture

    def test_something(your_custom_fixture):
        # Use the fixture in your test
        pass

Best Practices:
- Keep fixtures focused and reusable
- Document fixture parameters and return values
- Clean up resources in fixture teardown
- Use pytest.fixture decorator for proper lifecycle management
- Group related fixtures in separate modules
- Use appropriate fixture scopes (function, class, module, session)
- Provide default values and make fixtures configurable
