# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for {{ project_name }}.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a project. They provide context for why certain decisions were made and help future developers understand the reasoning behind the current architecture.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

Brief description of the problem or situation.

## Decision

What was decided and why.

## Consequences

Positive and negative consequences of the decision.
```

## ADR List

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-0001](0001-example-decision) | Example Architecture Decision | Accepted | {{ copyright_year }} |

*Add your project's architecture decisions here as they are made.*

## Adding New ADRs

To add a new ADR:

1. Create a new file named `XXXX-title.md` where XXXX is the next number in sequence
2. Follow the ADR format above
3. Update this index file to include the new ADR
4. Update the status as the decision progresses

## ADR Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: The decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: The decision has been made and implemented
- **Deprecated**: The decision is no longer relevant
- **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Contributing

When contributing to {{ project_name }}, consider whether your changes require a new ADR. Generally, ADRs are needed for:

- Major architectural changes
- Technology stack decisions
- Design pattern choices
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security considerations
