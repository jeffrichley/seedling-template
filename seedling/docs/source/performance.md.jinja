# Performance Guide

This document provides guidance on optimizing performance for {{ project_name }}.

## Overview

Performance optimization is crucial for providing a good user experience. This guide covers performance considerations, optimization techniques, and monitoring strategies.

## Performance Monitoring

```python
# TODO: Add performance monitoring for your project
import time
import psutil

def monitor_performance():
    start_time = time.time()
    start_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
    
    # Your processing code here
    
    end_time = time.time()
    end_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
    
    return {
        "execution_time": end_time - start_time,
        "memory_usage": (end_memory - start_memory) / 1024 / 1024  # MB
    }
```

## TODO: Add More Performance Features

This performance guide provides a foundation for {{ project_name }}. You should add performance features based on your specific needs:

1. **Caching**: Implement caching for expensive operations
2. **Memory Optimization**: Optimize memory usage for large datasets
3. **Algorithm Optimization**: Choose efficient algorithms and data structures
4. **I/O Optimization**: Optimize file and network operations
5. **Concurrency**: Add threading or async processing
6. **Benchmarking**: Create performance tests and benchmarks
7. **Profiling**: Set up code profiling to identify bottlenecks
8. **Monitoring**: Implement continuous performance monitoring
9. **Load Testing**: Test performance under various load conditions
10. **Resource Management**: Optimize CPU and memory usage
