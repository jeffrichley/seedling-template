```bash
# Quality checks
uv run dev lint          # Run linting
uv run dev typecheck     # Run type checking
uv run dev test          # Run tests
uv run dev checkit       # Run all quality checks

# Code formatting
uv run dev format        # Format code with black and ruff

# Documentation
uv run dev docs          # Build documentation
uv run dev docs-serve    # Serve documentation locally

# Analysis
uv run dev vulture       # Find dead code
uv run dev quality-gates # Run quality gates

# Help and info
uv run dev --help        # Show all commands
uv run dev info          # Show project status
```

**Note**: You can also use `uv run vine-dev` as an alternative to `uv run dev`.

**Direct Commands**: After installing with `uv pip install -e .`, you can call commands directly (when virtual environment is active):
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Then use direct commands
dev lint
dev test
dev checkit
vine-dev info
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from vine import TimelineBuilder

# Create a simple video with sequential timing
timeline = TimelineBuilder()
timeline.add_image("slide1.jpg", duration=5.0)
timeline.add_text("Welcome", duration=3.0)
timeline.add_voice("narration.mp3", duration=8.0)
timeline.export("output.mp4")

# Or use explicit timing for precise control
timeline = TimelineBuilder()
timeline.add_image_at("background.jpg", 0.0, duration=10.0)
timeline.add_text_at("Title", 2.0, duration=6.0)
timeline.add_voice_at("narration.mp3", 1.0, duration=8.0)
timeline.export("output.mp4")
```

### AI Agent Integration

```python
from vine import TimelineBuilder

# Load from AI-generated JSON (coming in Phase 2)
timeline = TimelineBuilder()
timeline.load_from_json(ai_generated_spec)
timeline.export("ai_video.mp4")
```

### YAML Configuration

```yaml
# video_spec.yaml (coming in Phase 2)
defaults:
  animation: "ken_burns"
  transition: "crossfade"
  resolution: "1080x1920"

timeline:
  - type: "image"
    path: "intro.jpg"
    start_time: 0.0
    duration: 5.0
  - type: "text"
    content: "Welcome"
    start_time: 2.0
    duration: 3.0
  - type: "voice"
    path: "narration.mp3"
    start_time: 1.0
    duration: 8.0
```

```python
from vine import TimelineBuilder

# Load from YAML (coming in Phase 2)
timeline = TimelineBuilder()
timeline.load_from_yaml("video_spec.yaml")
timeline.export("configured_video.mp4")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"

# Run quality checks
uv run dev checkit

# Format code
uv run dev format

# Run tests with coverage
uv run dev test-cov
```

**Direct Commands**: After installation, you can also use (when virtual environment is active):
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Then use direct commands
dev checkit
dev format
dev test-cov
```

### Available Development Commands

uv pip install -e .

# Development dependencies (linting, testing, type checking)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Documentation dependencies (Sphinx, themes)
uv pip install -e ".[docs]"

# Type checking dependencies (MyPy)
uv pip install -e ".[typecheck]"

# Security dependencies (pip-audit)
uv pip install -e ".[security]"

# All dependencies for full development
uv pip install -e ".[dev,docs,typecheck,security]"
```

**Available Groups:**
- **`dev`**: Development tools (Ruff, Black, pytest, MyPy, etc.)
- **`docs`**: Documentation tools (Sphinx, themes, etc.)
- **`typecheck`**: Type checking tools (MyPy)
- **`security`**: Security tools (pip-audit)
- **`test`**: Testing tools (pytest, hypothesis, benchmarks)

**Direct Commands**: After installation, you can also use (when virtual environment is active):
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Then use direct commands
dev checkit
dev format
dev test
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Install dependencies with `uv pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"`
2. **Develop**: Use `dev lint` and `dev typecheck` during development
